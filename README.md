# Automation of DMN Testing

1) Create a DMN
2) Parse the file
3) Autogenerate Test cases

Create a DMN :

  DMN is a modeling language and notation for the precise specification of business decisions and business rules.
  In DMN, we use diagrams to notate the decision making process.
  Business analysts can model rules that lead to a decision in the form of tables which are easy to read and these tables can be executed directly by a       decision engine. This minimises the risk of misunderstanding between business analysts and developers.

  DMN elements :
  
  DMN models consist of the following five elements:
  
    1) Decisions: Nodes in the model where one or several inputs determine an output based on decision logic.
    2) Input data: Information necessary to determine a decision. 
    3) Business knowledge models: Reusable pieces of decision logic. 
    4) Knowledge sources: External regulations, documents, committees, policies, and so on that shape decision logic. 
    5) Decision service: A decision service is a top-level decision, with well-defined inputs, that is published as a service for invocation.

  Create a file with .dmn extension in VSCode, the file with .dmn extension are automatically displayed as graphical models.
